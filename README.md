# Livemaps

This plugin was developed using [Rocket Mod](https://rocketmod.net/) libraries for the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) game [Unturned](http://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/). The Rocket Mod plugin collects server, player, and chat data recurrently and then saves the data to the user-configured MySQL database. The API provides an AJAX interface for retrieving the latest JSON-encoded server data. Livemap API responses are used to update the WebUI maps.

*The WebUI portion of this plugin is optional*, and is intended only as a default theme for this project. The API may be used independently to support fully custom livemap themes and features.

**How to Install:**

***Plugin***
1. Compile project
2. Copy `Livemap.dll` to Unturned rocket plugin directory
3. Start/stop server to generate config and configure MySQL database
4. Add Rocket permission for `/livemap` command to `Permissions.config.xml`
    - *Example*: `<Permission Cooldown="0">livemap</Permission>`
5. Restart Server

***WebUI***
1. Copy folder contents from `www` to web server.

***API***
1. Edit `www/api/config.api.php` and configure MySQL database connection settings
2. Send GET request to `www/api/livemap.api.php?livemap=server_id` for JSON-encoded response
    
    **Filtering Results**
    1. Table filtering is accomplished by specifying a table name `filter` within the GET request. By default, a null GET `filter` returns all livemap table results.
        - *Example*
            - *URI*: `?livemap=server_id&filter=livemap_data`
            - *Result*: Only `livemap_data` table results are returned
